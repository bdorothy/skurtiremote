**CP Analytics** is an ExpressionEngine 2.0 accessory which displays an overview of your site's Google Analytics statistics. The accessory displays quick stats for Today and Yesterday (visits, pageviews, average pageviews per visit, and average visit length), with increased stats for the past 31 days (visits, pageviews, average pageviews per visit, average visit length, bounce rate, percentage of new visits, top content and top referrers). The 31-day stats also include sparklines to visualize site activity.
##Installation

Upload the **cp_analytics** folder to your **/system/expressionengine/third_party/** directory, then activate the accessory and extension from the **Add-Ons -> Accessories** menu. Then, provide your Google Analytics account credentials and select one of your available account profiles to display using the CP Analytics extension settings.

CP Analytics caches your "yesterday" and "last month" stats daily, and "today's" stats hourly.

##Compatibility

CP Analytics requires ExpressionEngine 2.0 PB and PHP 5+, and is MSM-compatible. Thine eye will be most pleased when gazing upon this accessory whenst employing the Default or Fruit themes.
