		<h3>Additional Fields</h3>
		<p>Add the following field to your checkout_form to pass the currency code to Sage. GBP is the default if this field is not set or is blank. Use 3 Character currency codes only. 
		<br /> 
		<input type='hidden' value='GBP' name='currency_code' /></p>
		
		<p>Add the following field to your checkout_form to pass a purchase description to Sage that will show up on the customers credit card statement.

		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>IP Address: You need to register any IP address you're using to test with your SagePay Account, or your tests and live transactions will fail. <br />
		<br />Credit Card Numbers: Sage requires specific credit card numbers to be used during testing. Without using these credit card numbers, your tests will always fail.
